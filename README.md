# NC News

## Introduction 

NC News is a news and social platform, with the aim of creating a hub for users to connect while posting short news articles and viewpoints on the things that interest them. The app aims to be smaller in scale than national news sites and is more focussed on connecting users, than on the content they may be connecting over. It is more analogous to a friendly Discord server, where the users help craft their own experience by interacting with the site and making it their own. NC News has more detail than tweets on Twitter, but is more personal than BBC News.  
  
  I chose to build a news and social app, because I am interested in the news and how we communicate information. I have consumed a selection of news and social media over the last few years, so I had some prior experience in the area.  
    
    It was a good opportunity to consolidate what I had learned during the front-end section of the Northcoders bootcamp. 

The backend repo for this application is: https://github.com/rvallely/ncNewsApp .  
  
  There is also a link to the hosted API there.
## Process and Aims

I began by wireframing my application and drawing a component tree.

## What I Learned

## Challenges 

Styling in a way that worked for many different screens sizes. Galaxy Folds were sent to test us!

## Future Steps  
  
  In the future I'd like to:  
    
    . add the functionality to sign up new users
    . allow users to be able to post articles on any topic
    . have a top users feature from a most commented on or upvoted article of the day
    . have a way for users to report content that violated basic safeguarding rules
