# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Introduction 

NC News is a news and social platform, with the aim of creating a hub for users to post short news articles and viewpoints about the things that matter to and interest them. The app is smaller in scale than national news sites and is more focussed on connecting users, than focussed necessarily on the content they may be connecting over. I see it as more analogous to a friendly Discord server, where the users help craft their own experience by interacting with the site. NC News has more detail than tweets on Twitter, but is more personal than BBC News.

I chose to build a news and social app, because I am interested in the news and how we communicate information. I have consumed a selection of news and social media in various forms over the last few years, so I had some prior knowledge/experience in the area.
