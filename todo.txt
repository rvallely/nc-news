* do basic styling of elements
  - sizing
  - spacing
  - font 
  - colors
  - decide where Nav should be on each page
* in map of articles each element should be <ul> and then <li with a key!> and needs to return relevant info as only returning a title atm
* dynamically creating title and content for each topic page
* sort_by and order drop downs
* User icon and logged in as
* Start thinking about the intereactive User elements like writing comments and voting
* create profile
* get time?
* add is loading so content not loading at diff times- looks sloppy
